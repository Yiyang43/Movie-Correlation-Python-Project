# Movie-Correlation-Python-Project

# Introduction
This Project performed data-analysis on the Movie Industry Data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies) using Python to find what variables affects movie's revenue.

In this project, we are going to see if there is correlation within the data between the gross revenue of a film and any other aspect(including genre, director, released time, and so on); the initial hypothesis is that gross revenue and budget will have a positive correlation.

# Dataset


The dataset contains 6820 movies in total (220 movies per year, 1986-2016). Each movie has the following attributes:

- budget: the budget of a movie. Some movies don't have this, so it appears as 0

- company: the production company

- country: country of origin

director: the director

genre: main genre of the movie.

gross: revenue of the movie

name: name of the movie

rating: rating of the movie (R, PG, etc.)

released: release date (YYYY-MM-DD)

runtime: duration of the movie

score: IMDb user rating

votes: number of user votes

star: main actor/actress

writer: writer of the movie
